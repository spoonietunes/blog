      <description>Today was like many days I&amp;rsquo;ve had in the past. I wake up, get an idea in my head, and spend the majority of the day working on that one idea. Sometimes that idea splinters into a constellation of other ideas. Sometimes when the constellation gets too large, the nodes too numerous, my anxiety kicks in to high gear. How am I going to accomplish all of these things before I have to go to sleep tonight?</description>

      <description>Back in 2019, shortly after my Bipolar II diagnosis, I started an anonymous blog. (This blog is a reboot of that blog.) Naturally it was my hypomania that gave me the idea and motivated me to do it. If you are bipolar as well, the pressure (the need the ridiculously strong urge) to create might be something you&amp;rsquo;re familiar with.
So I created the blog and just as quickly deserted it.</description>

      <description>In my last post I described a bit of my history and events leading up to my search for a therapist. In this post, Iâ€™ll share how I came to find a therapist and what happened next. Note: This was originally posted in June 2019, about 15 days after my bipolar diagnosis
Searching for a therapist I thought finding a therapist would be easy. I logged into my insurance website, clicked about 24 buttons and links, and was faced with a list of 300-some mental health providers in my geographic area and in my network.</description>

Trigger warning: Depression
Like many bipolar individuals (or individuals living with bipolar disorder) I was misdiagnosed with clinical depression and anxiety at first. This is apparently very common, with a correct diagnosis of bipolar disorder on average taking a staggering 10 years! After my first diagnosis, my doctor put me on Zoloft. At first, things got a lot better.</description>
