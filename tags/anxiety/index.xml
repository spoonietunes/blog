      <description>Content warning: self-harm
I&amp;rsquo;m in the midst of a hypomanic episode. A few days ago was closest I&amp;rsquo;ve ever been to checking myself into the psych ward!
For a couple months I&amp;rsquo;ve had a pretty elevated mood - I&amp;rsquo;ve been going very fast, moving fast, speaking quickly, tons of ideas, high anxiety, high irritability. I call this &amp;ldquo;turbo.&amp;rdquo;
This seems to happen every Spring and Fall. This Spring it was bad enough that I went on a new medicine, seroquel.</description>

      <description>Today was like many days I&amp;rsquo;ve had in the past. I wake up, get an idea in my head, and spend the majority of the day working on that one idea. Sometimes that idea splinters into a constellation of other ideas. Sometimes when the constellation gets too large, the nodes too numerous, my anxiety kicks in to high gear. How am I going to accomplish all of these things before I have to go to sleep tonight?</description>

      <description>In my last post I described a bit of my history and events leading up to my search for a therapist. In this post, Iâ€™ll share how I came to find a therapist and what happened next. Note: This was originally posted in June 2019, about 15 days after my bipolar diagnosis
Searching for a therapist I thought finding a therapist would be easy. I logged into my insurance website, clicked about 24 buttons and links, and was faced with a list of 300-some mental health providers in my geographic area and in my network.</description>

      <description>This was originally posted in June 2019, about 15 days after my bipolar diagnosis
Trigger warning: Depression
Like many bipolar individuals (or individuals living with bipolar disorder) I was misdiagnosed with clinical depression and anxiety at first. This is apparently very common, with a correct diagnosis of bipolar disorder on average taking a staggering 10 years! After my first diagnosis, my doctor put me on Zoloft. At first, things got a lot better.</description>
