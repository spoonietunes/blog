      <description>Trigger warning: hypomania
One of the toughest things for me when it comes to hypomania is resisting the urge to lean into it.
As many bipolar folks can attest, hypomania (perhaps even mania) feels good. Well, it feels good until it doesn&amp;rsquo;t. Personally, my hypomania is usually filled with euphoria, extreme productivity (the results are sometimes of dubious quality, however), and a drive to do things. When I&amp;rsquo;m experiencing a low-grade hypomanic episode like I am now, it&amp;rsquo;s tempting to try and take advantage of it.</description>

      <description>Today was like many days I&amp;rsquo;ve had in the past. I wake up, get an idea in my head, and spend the majority of the day working on that one idea. Sometimes that idea splinters into a constellation of other ideas. Sometimes when the constellation gets too large, the nodes too numerous, my anxiety kicks in to high gear. How am I going to accomplish all of these things before I have to go to sleep tonight?</description>
